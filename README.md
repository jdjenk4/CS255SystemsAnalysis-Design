## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  DriverPass is a company that required a functioning system that had the ability to take in new customers, provide up to date training, and allow customers to tune into classes and sign up for on-the-road training. The system should also be accessible from any device as long as there is internet available. They wanted the system to be up to date with the most recent changes to the DMV as well as customer data.
  
## What did you do particularly well?
  I think the thing that I did the best is generating security measures. Here, I made recommendations for a 3 layer system that would help keep the customers accounts secure. These included a case-sensitive username and password, a lockout timer after several incorrect combinations, and incorporating multifactor authentication (MFA).
  
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  Between these two documents, I think I would revise my UML class diagram. I would keep the entities but redo the attributes of each entity. I would also ame sure that the new attributes had the appropriate notations to specifiy how they relate to the entitiy.
  
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I took my own experience of visiting websites and what I liked and disliked. I also have seen forums of other users across the web and their priases and concerns with websites. From this information and the requirements of DriverPass, I was able to curate recommendations for DriverPass that would help their website flourish. It is important for DriverPass to take into account the needs of the customers so that they don't lose touch with their base. They can take in suggestions from users and incorporate the feedback. This will help to ensure that the GUI is user friendly and operating accordingly.
  
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I think the best way of approaching software design is to take it increments. Cramming everything in one sitting can make any one person go crazy. I believe that spacing out the projects is helpful as well as having diagrams to visualize the process. UML diagrams can help visualize the code and relationships between entities while other diagrams can help visualize the overall project to see due dates and expectations. Also utilizing reputable forums like GitHub, Stack Overflow, or Stack Exchange can help with getting questions answered or feedback on code. People in these forums are usually other programmers or have knowledge in the field and provide explanations for their reasoning.
